Hi $first name$<BR><BR>I hope all is well and business is good for you. I know it's not been long since we last spoke but I wanted to let you know about an offer we're currently running.<BR><BR>To coincide with the largest technology and venture-backed IPO ever (<A href="http://t.co/nXByrCch">http://t.co/nXByrCch</A>), we are taking on assignments for an introductory rate of just 15% of a successful candidate's first year remuneration until the end of June 2012. That means you get to find some awesome new people in EMEA or APAC for half our standard fee; an offer that you'll hopefully ‘like’ even more than a share in FB.<BR><BR>Although you haven't retained us before, this is a perfect opportunity to give us a chance to bring a bit of fun and excitement back to your hiring process and let us show you that headhunting firms can be as cool as Facebook too. And to virtually eliminate your risk of using a new firm, our standard guarantee period is 2 years, 8 times longer than many of our competitors offer... not to mention the fact we still have a 100% fill-rate on exclusive and retained search work, proving we really don't give up!<BR><BR>We really believe that hiring the right people is the single most important factor to your and your company's success. The return of hiring a superstar over "someone who can do the job" is virtually unbeatable (<A href="http://t.co/fR7GvPU5">http://t.co/fR7GvPU5</A>). So if you have an important hire on the horizon, I urge you (even if you don't use Akascia), to be sure that it gets the attention it deserves. Now is not the time to just farm it out to the 4 or 5 agencies you always use who'll probably spend a few days working on it and send you the closest, first three matches they find online or on their database.<BR><BR>If you want to see a bit more about what we believe in and how we do things, you can view our online Prezi presentation at <A href="http://prezi.com/vlkj-0zgljej/akascia-in-a-nutshell/">http://prezi.com/vlkj-0zgljej/akascia-in-a-nutshell/</A>. So if you're a bit tired of using the same old search firms, sending you the same old types of candidates, do something awesome and get in touch with me today to find out how we can help.

<UL>

<LI>Have you hired someone through a retained executive search firm in EMEA or APAC in the last 12 months?</LI>

<LI>Has the person already left your business or are they just not working out?</LI>

<LI>If so, <STRONG>we will find you a replacement, free of charge.</STRONG></LI></UL>Yes, you read that right; we know how much the cost of that hire is already hurting you and your business, so to make your life a little happier, we will put right someone else's work, absolutely free.
